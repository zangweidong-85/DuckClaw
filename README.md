## ❓ Why  DuckyClaw?
Most AI agent frameworks are powerful but cumbersome. They often come with costly subscriptions, complicated setups, and are layered on top of other frameworks and APIs. DuckyClaw offers a different path.

Built on a commercial-grade device–cloud AI agent foundation, DuckyClaw uniquely fuses on-device agents with the power of the cloud.

With a single TuyaOpen Key, you gain seamless access to the Tuya Cloud Platform and its next-generation device–cloud AI agents.

It’s lightweight and effortlessly deployable to almost any edge hardware. From WIFI connected MCUs to System on Chip ARM, to PC Ubuntus.

## 💡 Philosophy

DuckyClaw is inspired by the vision of making personal AI accessible, practical, and genuinely helpful—rooted not in corporate tools, but in the idea of an always-there companion that intuitively fits into your daily life and hardware. The project’s name and mascot of Cute Duck from Tuya, embrace the spirit of resourceful, adaptive creatures of Claw.

**Why a duck and a claw?** Ducks are omnipresent, adaptable, and thrive in almost any environment—just like DuckyClaw’s software, which you can deploy from microcontrollers to desktop Linux. The "claw" symbolizes precision, dexterity, and direct command over both your real-world devices and digital agents. With TuyaOpen, hardware integration is much more flexible, allowing you to easily connect a wide range of hardware features and capabilities directly into your agent. This project isn’t about replacing people—it’s about building a dependable, always-learning, always-improving companion you fully control with real-life hardware interfaces.



### Core Principles

- **Personal-first, not enterprise.** DuckyClaw is made for individuals and makers. Your workflows and day-to-day life come first, no bureaucracy or corporate bloat.
- **Lean core, plugin power.** Everything outside the essential C core—channels, providers, tools—is a plugin you can swap and extend.
- **Self-tuning and adaptive.** Learns via real episode memory and periodic self-review, with memory fading that helps it stay relevant.
- **IoT control memory.** DuckyClaw remembers device states, actions, and preferences as part of IoT_MEMORY.md, allowing it to build a rich contextual history of your devices and interactions. Of how you control other devices in the Tuya ecosystem.  This lets the agent adapt to your automation routines, device quirks, and personal preferences over time—enabling smarter, more intuitive IoT control that gets better the more you use it.
- **Config by conversation.** No thick config files: set up and modify your agent simply by chatting, both on hardware and in the cloud.
- **Distinctive personality.** Each instance has its own configuration and optional Hardware layer for characterful, helpful responses. 
- **Builds natively on C/TuyaOpen.** No Node, no Python frameworks glued on. Built from scratch for the boards and platforms you actually use.
- **Rapid to start.** Requires just a TuyaOpen key. Choose models and providers as needed—switch between them with the messaging interface anytime.
- **Unified model access.** With a single TuyaOpen API Access Key, you can tap into the latest models from GPT, Claude, Deepseek, Qwen, and more—choose the best model for each task, all seamlessly hosted and managed by Tuya.
- **Device and Cloud AI Agents.** DuckyClaw is natively built to support both agents that run locally on your device (“device agents”) and those that operate in Claw like manner the cloud (“cloud agents”). This hybrid architecture enables on-device actions, voice, and IoT control while also providing access to advanced cloud intelligence, remote coordination, and online skills, MCPs. You can configure, blend, or move workloads fluidly between device and cloud—giving you the flexibility to optimize for speed, privacy, and power as you choose.

## 🏛️ Architecture

![Architecture](https://images.tuyacn.com/fe-static/docs/img/62c1ad75-9f01-4911-9d30-c7bac463faec.png)

The DuckyClaw architecture combines local device agents and cloud agents under a unified system. At its core, it uses the TuyaOpen AI-Agent framework to handle messaging, automation, and control. Local hardware (like Raspberry Pi, ESP32, or Linux devices) runs its own Claw like loop agent, able to communicate directly with your devices via IoT and hardware interfaces. 


## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔌 Plugin/Skills Development

**Skill format**: Skills are `.md` files in the `skills/` directory. The agent gets a summary of them and follows the instructions. Use this structure:

```markdown
# Skill Title

One-line description.

## When to use
When the user asks about X / when Y happens.

## How to use
1. Call tool_A with ...
2. Then call tool_B ...
3. Reply with ...

## Example
User: "…" → use get_current_time, then web_search "…", then reply "…"
```

Add skills: put a new `name.md` in the skills dir (e.g. via the `write_file` tool), or add built-ins in `skills/skill_loader.c`. See existing skills there for examples.
